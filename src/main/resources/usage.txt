
  xq input [connect] [-js]

    WHERE:
      input = either a file name or dash (-) for standard input
      connect (optional) = either
         * a literal connection string starting with xcc:// or
           xccs://
         * the suffix of a property name in xq.properties

    FUNCTION:

      Execute input according to uri found either as "connect" on the
      command line, or in xq.properties.

      If "input" doesn't exist, .xq or .xqy suffix will be tried
      for XQuery, or .js for JavaScript.

      if xq.properties in the execution directory looks like this:

        uri = xcc://user:pass@host:port
        uri.qa = xccs://qa-user:qa-pass@qa-host:qa-port

      then
        xq count
      will execute count (or count.xqy) using the first URI, whereas
        xq count qa
      will use the second.

      A connection string given on the command line takes precedence.

        echo 'count(/)' xq -

      will run from standard input

      -js anywhere in the argument list will cause execution
      to be in JavaScript rather than XQuery, for example:

        echo 'fn.count(fn.doc())' | xq - -js
